recipe_3

## Recipe_4:
## Check for HTML or plain text emails
## All the emails seem to have a lot of embedded sites or links or images. So I am checking for the content type of the email.
## If the content type is text/plain then it means that the email is a plain text email, if it is text/html then it is an HTML email and if it is multipart/alternative then it is a mixed email.
## The assumption is that the emails with the content transfer encoding of base64 are the ones that are spam emails, since they are encoded and are not plain text. This means they are containing some sort of image or link or something that is not plain text.
