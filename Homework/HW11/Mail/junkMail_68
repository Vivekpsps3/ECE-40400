BB10 has launched.Â Adam Leach, principal analyst at Ovum, provides his initial reaction:

âThe Blackberry 10 platform offers a differentiated user experience in todayâs crowded and homogenous smartphone market. The Blackberry Z10 and Q10 will stand out from the Android masses and look distinct from Appleâs iPhone. The user experience of Blackberry 10 introduces some nice new features but importantly builds on Blackberryâs UI heritage and therefore will certainly appeal to existing Blackberry users. However, the challenge for the company will be to attract new users and those that have already moved to alternative smartphones.

"Blackberry has rightly focused on insuring that the Blackberry 10 devices have a large catalogue of content and applications which is now essential for any modern smartphone, and achieving 70,000 applications at the launch of a new platform is good start.

"However, Ovum believes that despite a well-designed Blackberry 10 platform, that will certainly attract short-term interest from existing users the company will struggle to appeal to a wider audience and in the long-term will become a niche player in the smartphone market."
